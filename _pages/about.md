## I am currently a scrum master at a small software company. In the next five to ten years, I plan to raise my family. During that time, I will continue learning the skills of a data scientist. Additionally, I plan to continue education in the field of neurology. Ultimately, I plan to become a researcher and combine the fields of data science and neurology in an effort to find cures for neurological conditions.
